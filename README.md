## Project 1: Handwritten Digit Recognition Algorithm 
- Utilized MNIST dataset, which provides a large collection of handwritten digit images.
- Standardized image pixel values to a common range to improve model performance.
- Constructed a deep neural network architecture.
- Trained the model on the preprocessed dataset, optimizing its parameters using the ADAM optimizer and the sparse categorical crossentropy loss function to minimize classification errors.
- Assessed the model's accuracy and precision.
